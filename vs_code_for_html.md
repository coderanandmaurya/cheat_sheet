   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>My First HTML Page</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
       <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

4. **Save the File**:

   - Click “Save”.

#### 3. **Run Your HTML File in a Web Browser**

2. **Open the File in a Web Browser**:
   - Double-click on the `index.html` file, or right-click on it and select “Open with” to choose your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

3. **View Your HTML Page**:
   - The HTML file will open in your web browser, displaying your webpage as it will appear online.

#### 4. **Edit and Refresh**
1. **Edit in VS Code**:
   - If you need to make changes to your HTML file, go back to VS Code, make the necessary edits, and save the file again.

2. **Refresh the Browser**:
   - After saving changes in VS Code, refresh the webpage in your browser (usually by pressing `F5` or `Ctrl + R`/`Cmd + R`) to see the updated content.

### Additional Tips
- **Live Server Extension**: For a more streamlined workflow, consider installing the “Live Server” extension in VS Code. This allows you to view changes in real-time without manually refreshing your browser.
  1. **Install Live Server**:
     - Open VS Code and go to the Extensions view by clicking the Extensions icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl + Shift + X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + X` (macOS).
     - Search for “Live Server” and click “Install”.

  2. **Open with Live Server**:
     - Right-click on your HTML file in the VS Code editor and select “Open with Live Server”. This will automatically open your HTML file in a browser and refresh it whenever you save changes.

Following these steps will help you create, edit, and view your HTML files effectively. Let me know if you need any more details or assistance!
